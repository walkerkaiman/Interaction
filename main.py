Interaction - Interactive Art Installation Framework
Main Application Entry Point

This file implements a singleton pattern to ensure only one instance of the
Interaction application can run at a time. This prevents port conflicts,
resource contention, and data corruption that can occur with multiple instances.

The singleton pattern uses a lock file mechanism:
1. Check if a lock file exists
2. If it exists, verify if the process is still running
3. If the process is dead, remove the stale lock file
4. If the process is alive, prevent startup
5. If no lock file exists, create one and start the application
6. Clean up the lock file on exit
